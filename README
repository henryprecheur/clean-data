To run the script copy the content of the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory into the
root of the repository and run run_analysis.R.

To run the script needs the following files in its working directory:

    features.txt
    activity_labels.txt
    test/X_test.txt
    test/y_test.txt
    test/subject_test.txt
    train/X_train.txt
    train/y_train.txt
    train/subject_train.txt

It will write the result of the analysis in the file clean.txt.

See CodeBook.md for a description of the values in clean.txt.
